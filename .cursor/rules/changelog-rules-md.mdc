ALWAYS update the Changelog.md under [Unreleased] when making any change. Follow the rules in this file for making changes to the changelog.
When Asked to Commit Staged Changes always check changelog to see if the changes in staged files are represented in the changelog before committing). If the changes in the staged files are not represented in the changelog, follow the rules in changelog-rules.md to add the changes to changelog.md under [Unrelease]. To check for changes, use git --no-pager diff --cached.
When releasing: Review [Unreleased] changes to determine version bump (features→minor, fixes→patch, breaking→major), move changes to new version section with date, commit as "release: Version X.Y.Z", and create git tag. When releasing, also create a release via Github CLI. The release notes should not contain newlines and instead use proper formatting.

#Changelog Rules
All notable changes to this project will be documented in changelog.md.

#Version Numbering
This project uses a three-number versioning system (X.Y.Z):

X (Major): Breaking changes, major feature overhauls

Y (Minor): New features, significant improvements

Z (Patch): Bug fixes, minor improvements

Example: Version 1.2.3

1: Major version

2: Minor version

3: Patch version

When to increment:

Major (X): When making incompatible changes that might break existing functionality

Minor (Y): When adding functionality in a backward-compatible manner

Patch (Z): When making backward-compatible bug fixes

#Making Changelog Entries
#For New Changes in Development:
Add changes under the [Unreleased] section

Categorize them under appropriate headers:

Added for new features

Changed for changes in existing functionality

Deprecated for soon-to-be removed features

Removed for removed features

Fixed for bug fixes

Security for vulnerability fixes

Technical for technical changes/dependencies

Keep entries concise but descriptive

#When Releasing a Version:
Convert the [Unreleased] section to a version number with today's date (e.g., [1.0.0] - 2024-01-20)

Create a new empty [Unreleased] section at the top

#General Rules:
Newest changes always go at the top of the file

Each version should be in descending order (newest to oldest)

Group related changes under the same category

Use bullet points for each entry

#Development Workflow:
For Every Code Change:

ALWAYS add an entry to the [Unreleased] section in this changelog

Write clear, descriptive change notes

Categorize changes appropriately using the headers above

Commit changes with meaningful commit messages

For Version Releases:

Move [Unreleased] changes to a new version section with today's date

Update version number in ProjectSettings.asset (bundleVersion)
